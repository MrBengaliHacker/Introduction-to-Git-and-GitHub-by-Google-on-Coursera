# Version Control Systems

## What Is Version Control?
A Version Control System (VCS) keeps track of changes made to files over time. It records who made a change, when it was made, and allows reverting to earlier versions if needed. Changes can be grouped into a single unit called a commit, which can also include information about why the change was made. This helps with collaboration, debugging, and understanding project history.

## Version Control and Automation
Version control systems are useful even for a single administrator. They allow quick rollbacks when changes break systems and help keep code and configuration files consistent. This makes automation, system recovery, and maintenance more reliable.

## What Is Git?
Git is a version control system created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of the Linux kernel. It is free, open source, and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Git uses a distributed architecture, where each contributor has a full copy of the repository locally. This makes Git fast, reliable, and usable with or without a network connection. Git can be used for small personal projects or large projects with thousands of contributors.

## Installing Git
To follow along with this course, Git must be installed locally and used
from the command line. You can check if Git is installed by running
`git --version`. If the version is outdated or not installed, Git can be
installed using a package manager or the official installer for your
operating system. Git is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and once
installed, it can be used directly from the command line.
