# Diff and Patch Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet contains reference commands and examples from the Google Coursera course **“Introduction to Git and GitHub”**. It is intended as a technical reference for understanding and using the `diff` and `patch` commands.

## The diff command
You use the `diff` command to find the differences between two files. On its own, it’s a bit hard to use; instead, use `diff -u` to find lines that differ in two files:

---

## Using diff -u
You use the `diff -u` command to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. For an example of what this looks like, see below:

### Example Files

```bash
~$ cat menu1.txt 
Menu1:

Apples
Bananas
Oranges
Pears
```
```bash
~$ cat menu2.txt 
Menu:

Apples
Bananas
Grapes
Strawberries
```
### Command
```bash
~$ diff -u menu1.txt menu2.txt 
```
### Output
```bash
--- menu1.txt   2019-12-16 18:46:13.794879924 +0900
+++ menu2.txt   2019-12-16 18:46:42.090995670 +0900

```

### Symbols Used

- Lines starting with `-` were removed

- Lines starting with `+` were added

- `@@` shows the line numbers and context of the change

## The patch command
The `patch` command is useful for applying file differences. See the example below, which compares two files. The comparison is saved as a `.diff` file, which is then patched to the original file!

### Example Files

```bash
~$ cat hello_world.txt 
Hello World
```
```bash
~$ cat hello_world_long.txt 
Hello World

It's a wonderful day!
```
### View the Differences
```bash
~$ diff -u hello_world.txt hello_world_long.txt 
```
```bash
--- hello_world.txt     2019-12-16 19:24:12.556102821 +0900
+++ hello_world_long.txt        2019-12-16 19:24:38.944207773 +0900
@@ -1 +1,3 @@

+
+It's a wonderful day!
```
### Generate the Diff File
```bash
~$ diff -u hello_world.txt hello_world_long.txt > hello_world.diff
```
### Apply the Patch
```bash
~$ patch hello_world.txt < hello_world.diff 
patching file hello_world.txt
```
### Verify the Result
```bash
~$ cat hello_world.txt 
Hello World

It's a wonderful day!

```
